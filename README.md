# üçΩÔ∏è Meal Optimization Project  

This project aims to create a smart, optimized meal plan that satisfies daily nutritional needs while minimizing costs and adhering to various dietary constraints. The model distributes **N food items** across three meals: **breakfast, lunch, and dinner**. It incorporates nutritional requirements, food categories, and special recommendations to provide a balanced, feasible, and cost-effective meal plan.

---

## üåü Features
- **Balanced Nutrition**: Ensures daily nutritional requirements for key nutrients (e.g., calories, protein, vitamins) are met.
- **Smart Distribution**: Optimizes food allocation across three meals, considering food suitability for specific meals.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizes meal plan cost while maintaining high nutritional value.
- **Category Constraints**: Incorporates diverse food categories such as drinks, principal items, and desserts in every meal.
- **Custom Penalties**: Penalizes inclusion of foods not recommended for certain meals (e.g., heavy foods for dinner).

## üìÇ Project Files
1. **Input Files**
   - `food_data.csv`: Contains details about food items, nutritional values, categories, costs, and constraints.  
   - `not_recommended.csv`: Specifies which foods are not recommended for specific meals.

2. **Model File**
   - `optimization_model.mod`: Defines the mathematical optimization model, including variables, constraints, and the objective function.

3. **Solver Script**
   - `solver.py`: Python script to load data, run the optimization, and save the results.

4. **Output Files**
   - `meal_plan.csv`: Generated meal plan showing assigned food quantities for each meal.
   - `report.txt`: Summary of the optimization process, including cost and constraint violations.

## üéØ Optimization Goal
Minimize:  

$$
Total\ Cost + \lambda \cdot Penalty\ for\ Not\ Recommended\ Foods
$$

Subject to:
- Daily nutritional requirements.
- Meal-specific food constraints.
- Category diversity in each meal.
